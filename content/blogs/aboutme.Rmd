# Who am I?
My name is Mengyu LIU and I am from China (Mengyu means wings of dreams in Chinese), and you can also contact me with my English name Violet or Japanese name Yumeha (means wings of dreams in Japanese). I was born in midsummer and I am 22 this year.
I studied business administration and language as an undergraduate in Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. ESG information disclosure is a passion of mine at that time, so for my dissertation I researched the effect of ESG disclosure on influences of companies’ green innovation accomplishments, and the impact on the market expectations. I’m now studying a Masters at London Business School because I want to broaden my understanding of business fundamentals, whilst deepening my specific interest in finance and investment.

# What I have done in the past
## Before university
I studied at Wuhan Foreign Languages School before college. Wuhan is a beautiful and kind city in the middle of China, near the Yangtze River. During high school, I have devoted myself to students’ affairs at student association and several events at *MUN*. (MUN is the abbreviation of Model United Nations, where students discuss social or political affairs, representing different countries, just like real delegates in the UN.) I have taken part into conferences like Human Rights Council and International Criminal Police Organization. It was a great experience	where I got to communicate with those peers from high schools around China.

# University life
## Life in classroom
My major is Japanese language and I studied business administration for second degree. I started to learn Japanese with no previous foundation four years ago and managed to use it fluently now. I chose to learn business basically because I want to learn how can a company grow better on the financial basis. I also attended *BID* (Business Intelligence Design Program) in Tsinghua University, where I learnt a lot practices about company valuation and business models.

## Life in real world internship
I’ve had a variety of internships, from which I have been continually gaining competency and business skills in fields of investment banking, private equity and consulting during my university life. I have been working for CITIC Investment and held interviews with executives of top suppliers and customers. Also, when working in IBD, I have directed a team of 5 and liaised with client to manage time-critical due diligence. 
When looking back, the elements that I’ve consistently enjoyed through these experiences, have been the culturally diverse teams I’ve been a part of – as someone who has spent half their life living as a foreigner, this is incredibly important to me. Because things I learnt from diverse backgrounds help me perform better when communicating with foreign clients and colleagues. It was not like something I’d worked on before, but it was a great experience. 
Since coming to LBS I’ve been surprised at how much I've enjoyed diversified studying atmosphere. We work in groups with quantitative backgrounds and we share our opinions for every topic of class. Also, I've known how important making financing choice is to a company, and I've been able to see and learn more about how financial analysis can inform investment decisions. I once worked for a PE focusing on real estate market, at that time I didn’t know much about investment analysis as today, so it is incredible for me to realize that I understand more and can do more than two years before, with a much solid foundation. 
I am a creative and innovative person, which means I get lots of job satisfaction when I am helping to create or improve a new and exciting product or service for my employers’ customers and clients. I am intensely competitive, but at the same time understanding that the organizations needs must come above my own and I will always work collaboratively with my co-workers and stakeholders to ensure you stay at the forefront of the sector.

## Life in building leaderships
In the university, I was the vice president of Sino-Japanese Communication Association and have organized large-scale Japanese cultural festival, Kimono Exhibition (with 20K+ RMB budget for 2K+ participants) and many other culture events.
Also, I have worked as the  minister of communicating in Students Unions of department for two years, elected by faculty to lead a team of 8 in charge of organizing academic events inviting 15+ scholars and 300+ students per year.
