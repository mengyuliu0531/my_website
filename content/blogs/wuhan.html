<h1>Where is Wuhan</h1>
<p>I was born in Wuhan, the biggest and most populous city in central China.
The name “Wuhan” came from the city’s historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the “Three Towns of Wuhan”. Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtzeriver and its largest tributary, the Han River, and is known as <strong>“Nine Provinces’ Thoroughfare”</strong>.</p>

<div id="cuisine" class="section level1">
<h1>Cuisine</h1>
<p>Hubei cuisine is one of China’s ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others.</p>
<p>“No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and <em>tangyuan</em> are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.” This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as <em>Qingshuizong</em> (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk,tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles <em>(reganmian)</em> in modern times.</p>
<p><em>Guozao</em> is a popular way to say ‘having breakfast’ in Wuhan, and a part of the city’s culture, which is the thing <strong>I miss most</strong> here in UK. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places.
Duck’s neck or <em>Ya Bozi</em> is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.
Bean skin or <em>Doupi</em> is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.
Soup dumpling or <em>Xiaolongtangbao</em> is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) – every time one takes a bite from it the “soup” inside is liable to spill out.
A salty doughnut or mianwo is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.</p>

<h1>Natural beauty in Wuhan</h1>
<p>Wuhan, a city where you can not only enjoy great natural beauty like cherry blossom and the night view of Yangtze river, but also feel the profound verve of its culture and history.
I would recommend you to take a look at Qintai Grand Theatre, Wuhan Customs House, Wuhan University, East Lake and Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge if you plan to visit Wuhan.</p>

<h1>Renewal from virus</h1>
<p>Located in central China, one of the six megacities, Wuhan, has become globally known as the epicenter of the COVID-19 since January 2020. With 9 million people being trapped in Wuhan for two months, people went through some toughest times in life: anxiety, disappointment, depression as well as sadness about illness, quarantine, disconnection and grief…nevertheless, they are not easily defeated by the virus. Among the regional cultural differences in China, the Wuhanese personalities are often depicted as optimistic, flexible and inclusive. I am so proud of Wuhan and Wuhanese, for we are brave when facing the virus.</p>
